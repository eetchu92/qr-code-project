## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Box Model


### What I learned

This project was all about using the box model to design the QR code. I had to work with padding and margins along with the width property to make sure that my final project looked similar to the mockup. Hopefully, I did this one correctly as well. I was so happy when i figured out that I could manipulate the margins of the H1 and P tags to make them fit underneath the image. All in all, this was a great experience and I learned quite a lot.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.jsfiddle.com) - This helped me play around with the code so that I wouldn't mess up what I was doing on VS Code. Then I simply copied and pasted everything at the end. 
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is an amazing resource I use all the time when I want to find quick answers.
